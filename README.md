# jMoped-Flow

This is a prototype implementation of jMoped-Flow, a PDS-based information flow analyzer based on [jMoped](http://www2.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/fmi/szs/tools/moped/jmoped/translator/). It can translate the Java bytecode into Remopla file which can be verified by [Moped](http://www2.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/fmi/szs/tools/moped/) model checker to enforce noninterference.
